# TicketingSystem

This is a program about a ticketing system to calculate the daily fare. 

The following are the rules:

1.  Zone based:
      Every zone has its predetermine fare
2.  Peak/Non-peak hour fare:
      Based on the zone and time, peak or non peak fare is calculated
3. Fare capping:
      When a commuter has travelled sufficient number of trips to cover for the daily limit, then the next trip is discounted or free.
      When a commuter has travelled sufficient number of trips to cover for the weekly limit, then the next trip is discounted or free.
